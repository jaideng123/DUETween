# What is DUETween?
DUETween is a framework that allows you to add quick & easy animations to actors in your Unreal Engine games. It provides APIs for both Blueprint and C++ and aims to be flexible, yet memory and runtime efficient.

Current features:
   * Provides an extended library of easing functions (See [easings.net](https://easings.net/)).
   * Lean and efficient using ~1.5mb memory and ticking at <0.5ms for 4000 concurrent tweens.
   * Out of the box functionality for common tweens like location and rotation.
   * Use reflection to conveniently tween UProperties with via field names.
   * Both Blueprint & C++ APIs.

I built DUETween because I fell in love with [DOTween](https://dotween.demigiant.com/) while making Unity games and couldn't find any existing plugins in Unreal that replicated it's power and ease of use.
